# LinkedList

## Setup

```
To set up a Linked List data structure, we need to have construct a Node which consists of the Data, to store the data, and a head to link to the next Node.
There is a few methods that are essential in building a LinkedList, they are:
* length()
* add(data, index)
* get(index)
* remove(index)
* print()

```

## Start

```
To start a list, we call in a new LinkedList object with a data to store in it. From here on, we can use the methods available to manipulate the list.
